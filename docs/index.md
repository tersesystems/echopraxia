# Echopraxia

[Echopraxia](https://github.com/tersesystems/echopraxia) is a Java logging API designed around structured logging, rich context, and conditional logging.  There are Logback and Log4J2 implementations, but Echopraxia's API is completely dependency-free, meaning it can be implemented with any logging API, i.e. jboss-logging, JUL, JEP 264, or even directly.
